A classifier used for sentiment analysis of product reviews. The training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

In order to automatically analyze reviews, the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm have been implemented and used on the food review dataset.
